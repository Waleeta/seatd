Be seated when you need it.

## What is Seatd
Seatd is a mobile app that finds open, immediately available appointments for various personal services (*hair*, *nails*, *your favorite tattoo artist*). We seek to solve the problem of "uh oh. My stylist isn't available for a month and I have a wedding tomorrow. How can I find someone today without going through all of Yelp and making a dozen calls?"

## The app is currently in development
Seatd is currently undergoing development, and we hope to have a working product soon. For now, you can use our code and, using [Ionic View](http://view.ionic.io/) to view it on your phone, or [Ionic Emulator](http://ionicframework.com/docs/cli/run.html) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/) to emulate the app on your computer.

All of the current data is seeded, dummy data.
